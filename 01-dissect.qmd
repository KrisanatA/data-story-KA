## Goal

### Who is the target audience?

There is no target audience in this data story. The author should have a target audience of who the author wants to read this story. For example, do you want the medical practitioner to read it, or do you want to raise awareness among the general audience?

### What is the intended message?

From reading the report, I assume that the intended messages are the main cause of death. I think that the author only presents the analysis of the messages. I think it is a good idea to touch a bit more on the purpose of this story. For example, from one of your intended messages, what are the main cause of death? The author could analyze more on does the top diseases change over time or does this is different in different countries.

### Why should the audience care or what should the audience do with the message?

In the analysis, the author mostly presented the findings. However, the author did not explain what the users can take away from this data. For example, since the highest cause of death is cardiovascular disease, people should exercise more since one of the main factors for this disease is physical inactivity.

## Story 

### What type of story was it?

From the question, I assume that the author's story type is "change over time." However, I feel like this is more like a "drill-down" type, as I did not see the author touch more on the year variable. I would suggest the author touch on how this changes over time.

### Was the story interesting to you?

From this, I could only see that the author is presenting two different sections health-related causes and non-health related. But not why the author does that. To make the story more interesting, I think the author should aim more at one specific issue, whether it health related or non-health related. And since the story type of the question seems to be "drill-down." It would be a good idea to explore more on a specific year.

## Selected data

### Was the right data used for the intended message? 

Since the main message is to present the causes of death to the reader, the right data was used. The recommendation is for the author to focus more on diseases and ignore the non-health-related causes. Also, the author could look at a specific year.

### What are the limitations of the data used for the story?

The author did not explain the limitation of this data. For example, this data only has the year up to 2016, and not all diseases are presented here.

### What data would have made the message more convincing?

If the author aims to do the "drill-down story," I suggest the author look at the specific year and explore more on the continent variable and country variable.

## Selected visualisation

### Was the visualisation effective for the intended message?

In the first section, what are the main causes of death? The table on the top five health-related causes of death is a good idea. However, I think that adding the mortality rate to it would be more meaningful since the reader can see how far apart each disease is. Also, as I have mentioned, look at a specific year more since comparing the year in your second table does not make sense on why you want to do that. With the bar plot you presented, since the author wants to aim to show the country, it is hard to see what countries have what causes of death.

### What other visualisations could be used?

Since the analysis is aiming for the "drill-down" story, the map could be used to present the different mortality rates between countries.

## Aesthetic design

### Are the choices of aesthetic elements helpful in arousing interest without overly hampering cognition?

The bar plot inside the table helps distinguish the difference between the disease mortality rate. The color choices for the causes are used correctly. Since it is not ranking, the sequential color will not work.

### How could the aesthetic design be improved?

The table showing the top five causes of death includes the mortality rate to show how much is different between each cause of death. The table on the countries with the highest mortality rate for both health-related and non-health related is not the same. The legend for health-related is health causes while non-health related is country.
